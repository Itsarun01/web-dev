<h2>About  Skeleton Loading Effect </h2>

<p>Skeleton loading is a visual technique used to enhance user experience during loading times by displaying placeholder elements that resemble the structure of actual content. Instead of showing a blank screen or a loading spinner, skeleton loading shows “skeleton” shapes in place of the content, giving users an impression of what’s to come. This effect makes loading feel faster and less jarring, reducing the perceived waiting time.</p>
